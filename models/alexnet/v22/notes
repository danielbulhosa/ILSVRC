Same as v20 but reducing alpha to 0.1 and k to 0.2 so that
output weights are O(1), which is a best practice. We don't
expect this to have a major effect.

We increased the magnitude of image perturbations from 0.1
to 1. We manually perturbed individual images and found that:

- The eigenvalues of the covariance matrix are tiny 
- Because of this at scale 0.1 the perturbations look a lot
  like the original image
- We manually tried out perturbations at scale 1 and the 
  perturbations tended to stay within one sigma! Furthermore
  even looking at the perturbed output visually it looked
  enough like the original image to be recognizeable.

We're hoping that more aggressive augmentation will lead to
better regularization. We may try slightly increasing weight
and bias regularization to get the asymptote of accuracy closer
to our target, if the asymptote doesn't reduce in this experiment.
