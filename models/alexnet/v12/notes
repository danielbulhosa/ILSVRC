Have a feeling I made a typo with the bias regularization weight decay. It
should be 0.0005 instead of 0.005. v12 is the same as v10 but reducing weight
decay for bias terms to 0.0005 instead of 0.005. This is the same as v11, but adding
weight and bias regularization of magnitude 0.0005. 

If this doesn't work we'll try removing bias regularization altogether. If that
overfits or fails generally perhaps we do need bias regularization but a higher
initial learning rate.
