The same as v25 but removing LRN and dropout. We're basically
just testing image augmentations to see if this will give us
the regularization boost we need relative to v24 and v23. 
We will also removed batch normalization from the fully connected
layers.

We expect the convergence behavior will be close to v24 when 
optimizing for validation accuracy so it'll likely take a
little while to run this one.
