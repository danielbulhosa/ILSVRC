Same as v15 but we revert to the original patience and loss threshold.
We think setting the patience to 3 epochs was a bit aggressive and we
may have missed out on further optimization. We don't have a clear idea 
of the delta threshold yet, and we think later in training a smaller delta
may be better. Thus we're going to reduce it back to 0.0001 and increase the
patience back to 10.

We are also going to try to increase the batch size. The GPU has been running
at 70% and we think there may be room to increase utilization. We're going to give 
it a shot and see it we can do it without crashing the job.
